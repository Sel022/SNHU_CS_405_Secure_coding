Best Practices in C/C++ Development
1. Code Quality
•	Followed Google C++ Style Guide for consistent code formatting.
•	Used Clang-Tidy and CppCheck for static code analysis.
2. Performance Optimization
•	Profiling with gprof and Valgrind.
•	Memory management using smart pointers and custom allocators.
3. Testing and Debugging
•	Unit testing with Google Test Framework.
•	Debugging with gdb and logging with spdlog.
4. Modern C++ Features
•	Utilized features like lambda expressions, range-based loops, and type inference for cleaner and more expressive code.
•	Applied std::thread and std::async for concurrency.
5. Documentation and Version Control
•	Well-documented code using Doxygen.
•	Version control managed with Git and GitHub.
